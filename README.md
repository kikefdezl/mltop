## Introduction

**mltop** is a resource monitoring tool designed specifically for Machine Learning Engineers and those working with ML tasks. It was a born as a hybrid of [nvtop](https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop) (for monitoring GPUs) and [htop](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop) (for monitoring CPU and memory), allowing users to see a comprehensive view of their systemâ€™s performance in a single interface.

### Key Features

- Dual Resource Monitoring: Overlays CPU and GPU usage for spotting bottlenecks in your dataloader pipelines.
- Simplified UI: Combines the key features of `htop` and `nvtop`, so you don't need to open multiple tools.

--- 

**mltop** requires NVIDIA drivers to monitor NVIDIA GPU information.

**mltop** is written in Rust.


## Installation

You can easily install **mltop** via pre-built binaries or by compiling from source.


### Building from Source

1. Make sure you have Rust (Cargo) installed.

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kikefdezl/mltop.git
cd mltop
```

3. Build & run the project:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

### Pre-built Binaries

- Pre-built binaries to be added to releases soon. In the meantime, please build from source using Cargo.

## Dependencies

- **mltop** uses [nvml_wrapper](https://github.com/rust-nvml/nvml-wrapper) to fetch NVIDIA GPU information, which requires
interfacing with your NVIDIA Drivers. If those are not available, **mltop** won't be able to find your GPU.

Currently, only NVIDIA GPUs are supported, but support for different GPUs is in the roadmap.

## Usage

Once installed, run `mltop` in your terminal. The tool will run until you press `q` to quit.

## Roadmap

- Sorting processes by GPU/CPU/MEM usage
- Killing processes
- Support for multiple GPUs
- Support for other GPU vendors (AMD, Intel, etc.)
- Interactive customization of UI/UX

## Contributing
